<h1><span class="sp1">Pipe of Peace</span></h1>

<h2>By James McKimmey, Jr.</h2>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="273" height="400" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The farmer</span> refused to work.
His wife, a short thin woman
with worried eyes, watched him
while he sat before the kitchen
table. He was thin, too, like his wife,
but tall and tough-skinned. His
face, with its leather look was immobile.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked his wife.</p>

<p>"Good reasons," the farmer said.</p>

<p>He poured yellow cream into a
cup of coffee. He let the cup sit
on the table.</p>

<p>"Henry?" said the woman, as
though she were really speaking to
someone else. She walked around
the kitchen in quick aimless bird
steps.</p>

<p>"My right," said Henry. He lifted
his cup, finally, tasting.</p>

<p>"We'll starve."</p>

<p>"Not likely. Not until everybody
else does, anyway."</p>

<p>The woman circled the room and
came back to her husband. Her
eyes winked, and there were lines
between them. Her fingers clutched
the edge of the table. "You've gone
crazy," she said, as though it were
a half-question, a half-pronouncement.</p>

<p>The farmer was relaxing now,
leaning back in his chair. "Might
have. Might have, at that."</p>

<p>"<i>Why?</i>" she asked.</p>

<p>The farmer turned his coffee cup
carefully. "Thing to do, is all. Each
man in his own turn. This is my
turn."</p>

<p>The woman watched him for a
long time, then she sat down on a
chair beside the table. The quick,
nervous movement was gone out of
her, and she sat like a frozen sparrow.</p>

<p>The farmer looked up and grinned.
"Feels good. Just to sit here.
Does well for the back and the
arms. Been working too hard."</p>

<p>"Henry," the woman said.</p>

<p>The farmer tasted his coffee
again. He put the cup on the table
and leaned back, tapping his
browned fingers. "Just in time, I'd
say. Waited any longer, it wouldn't
have done any good. Another few
years, a farmer wouldn't mean anything."</p>

<p>The woman watched him, her
eyes frightened as though he might
suddenly gnash his teeth or leap in
the air.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon," the farmer said,
"they'd have it all mechanical.
Couldn't stop anything. Now," he
said, smiling at his wife, "we can
stop it all."</p>

<p>"Henry, go out to the fields," the
woman said.</p>

<p>"No," Henry said, standing,
stretching his thin, hard body. "I
won't go out to the fields. Neither
will August Brown nor Clyde
Briggs nor Alfred Swanson. None
of us. Anywhere. Not until the
food's been stopped long enough
for people to wake up."</p>

<p>The farmer looked out of the
kitchen window, beyond his tractor
and the cow barn and the windmill.
He looked at rows of strong
corn, shivering their soft silk in the
morning breeze. "We'll stop the
corn. Stop the wheat. Stop the cattle,
the hogs, the chickens."</p>

<p>"You can't."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can't. But all of us together
can."</p>

<p>"No sense," the woman said,
wagging her head. "No sense."</p>

<p>"It's sense, all right. Best sense
we've ever had. Can't use an army
with no stomach. Old as the earth.
Can't fight without food. Takes
food to run a war."</p>

<p>"You'll starve the two of us,
that's all you'll do. Nobody else will
stop work."</p>

<p>The farmer turned to his wife.
"Yes, they will. Everywhere a farmer
is the same. He works the land.
He reads the papers. He votes. He
listens to the radio. He watches the
television. Mostly, he works the
land. Alone, with his own thoughts
and ideas. He isn't any different in
Maine than he is in Oregon. We've
all stopped work. Now. This morning."</p>

<p>"How about those across the
ocean? Are they stopping, too?
They're not going to feed up their
soldiers? To kill us if we don't
starve first? To&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They stopped, too. A farmer is
a farmer. Like a leaf on a tree. No
matter on what tree in what country
on whose land. A leaf is a leaf.
A farmer's the same. A farmer is a
farmer."</p>

<p>"It won't work," the woman said
dully.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will."</p>

<p>"They'll <i>make</i> you work."</p>

<p>"How? It's our own property."</p>

<p>"They'll take it away from you."</p>

<p>"Who'll work it then?"</p>

<p>The woman rocked in her chair,
her mouth quivering. "They'll get
somebody."</p>

<p>The farmer shook his head.
"Too many people doing other
things, like making shells and guns,
like sitting in fox-holes or flying
planes."</p>

<p>The woman sat rocking, her
hands together in her lap. "It won't
work," she repeated.</p>

<p>"It'll work," said the farmer.
"Right <i>now</i>, it'll work. Yes, we've
got milkers and shuckers, and
we've got hatchers for the chickens.
We've got tractors and combines
and threshing machines.
They're all mechanical, all right.
But we don't have mechanical
farmers, yet. The pumps, the tractors,
the milkers don't work by
themselves. In time, maybe. Not
now. We're still ahead of them on
that. It'll work."</p>

<p>"Go out to the fields, Henry,"
his wife said, her voice like the
sound of a worn phonograph record.</p>

<p>"No," the farmer said, taking a
pipe from his overalls. "I think instead,
I'll just sit in the sun and
watch the corn. Watch the birds on
top of the barn, maybe. I'll fill my
pipe and sit there and smoke and
watch. And when I get sleepy, I'll
sleep. After a while I might go see
August Brown or Clyde Briggs or
maybe Alfred Swanson. We'll sit
and talk, about pleasant things,
peaceful things. We'll wait."</p>

<p>The farmer put the pipe between
his teeth and walked to the
door. He put on his straw hat, buttoned
the sleeves of his blue shirt
and stepped outside.</p>

<p>His wife sat at the table, staring
at nothing in the room.</p>

<p>The farmer walked across the
barnyard, listening to the sound of
the chickens and the sound of the
breeze going through the corn.
Near the barn, he sat upon an old
tree stump and filled his pipe with
tobacco. He lit the pipe, cupping
his hands, and sat there, smoking,
the smoke spiraling up into the
bright warm air.</p>

<p>He took his pipe from his teeth
and looked at it. "Pipe of peace,"
he said, laughing inside himself.</p>

<p>The breeze was soft and the sun
warm on his back. He sat there,
smoking, feeling the quiet of the
morning, the peace of the great sky
above.</p>

<p>He had no time to stand or to
take his pipe from his mouth, when
the two men crossed the yard and
lifted him up by the arms. He
dropped the pipe, while he was
dragged past the house, to the road
beyond. He had no time to yell or
scream, before his hat was swept
from his head, the overalls and the
blue shirt stripped from his body.</p>

<p>He had not even thought about
what it was that had happened, before
he was thrust inside a white
truck, with strong steel sides and
with grilled windows like those of
a cell.</p>

<p>He was just sitting there, in the
truck, without his clothes, speeding
away with August Brown and
Clyde Briggs and Alfred Swanson.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Outside</span>, the sun was warm
upon the earth. Chickens
clucked in their pens, while birds
fluttered about the top of the barn.
A pig squealed. The corn rustled.
And beside the farmhouse, on the
ground, lay a pipe, its tobacco
spilled, the last of its smoke swirling
out of its bowl into the air, disappearing.</p>

<p>The woman sat in the kitchen of
the farmhouse and turned her
head when the door opened. She
widened her eyes and caught at
her throat with her hand.</p>

<p>The sun through the doorway
shone down on metallic hands and
a metallic face, gleaming on the
surface which the straw hat and
the overalls and the blue shirt
didn't hide. The door snapped
shut, and there was a sound of
heavy metal footsteps against the
kitchen floor.</p>

<p>The woman pressed against her
chair. "Who are you?" she
screamed.</p>

<p>"Henry," said the mechanical
thing.</p>
